# MFZ BYA IMACD2

Pine Script **v6** overlay indicator for TradingView.
Signal engine adapted from *Impulse MACD [LazyBear]* (open source) and re-engineered
into a live-ready setup with Entry / SL / TP1 / TP2 / TP3 levels and a TVMT webhook alert.

## Files
- `MFZ_BYA_IMACD2.pine` — the complete indicator, ready to paste into the TradingView Pine Editor.

## Signal
Default **Signal Mode = "Signal Line crosses MACD"** with **Signal Length 3** and **MA Length 10**:

- signal line (3) crosses **up** through the Impulse MACD line (10) → **BUY**
- signal line (3) crosses **down** through the Impulse MACD line (10) → **SELL**

Three other modes are selectable in Settings:
`Fast MA crosses Slow MA (price)` (plain EMA 3 over EMA 10 on price),
`MACD crosses Signal Line` (the original orientation), and `Zero Line Cross`.

## Key behaviour
- **No repainting** — signals are gated behind `barstate.isconfirmed`, so a printed marker never disappears.
- **Distance Method** dropdown: `Pip` / `ATR` / `Percentage`. All three engines are built in and apply to all four levels.
- **Pip rule**: 1 pip = 10 points = `10 * syminfo.mintick` (Auto), with a Manual override.
  - XAUUSD 2-decimal feed → pip `0.10` (150 pips = 15.00 in price)
  - XAUUSD 3-decimal feed → pip `0.01`
  - 5-digit forex → `0.0001` · 3-digit JPY → `0.01`
- **Only the latest setup is drawn** — previous lines and labels are deleted first.
- Lines extend right and labels re-anchor to the live edge every bar, so nothing scrolls off screen.
- Every marker shape, marker colour and line colour is an input.
- Every input uses `display = display.none`, so the chart status line shows only the indicator name.

## Alert setup (TVMT webhook)
1. Right-click the chart → **Add alert**
2. Condition: **MFZ BYA IMACD2** → pick **MFZ BUY (TVMT)** or **MFZ SELL (TVMT)**
3. Trigger: **Once Per Bar Close**
4. Leave the pre-filled JSON message exactly as it is — do not add any text
5. Notifications tab → **Webhook URL** → paste your TVMT bridge URL

Alert payload (values arrive as raw numbers via `{{plot("title")}}`):

```json
{
  "symbol": "{{ticker}}",
  "action": "buy",
  "entry": {{plot("entry")}},
  "sl": {{plot("sl")}},
  "tp": {{plot("tp")}},
  "tp2": {{plot("tp2")}},
  "tp3": {{plot("tp3")}},
  "tv_time": "{{timenow}}",
  "tv_alert_id": "tv-{{ticker}}-buy-{{time}}"
}
```

`"tp"` carries TP1. Levels are matched by plot **title**, not by number, so plot order can never break the webhook.

## Win-rate dashboard
Top-right table. It makes no signals of its own — it replays the indicator's own entries against the
same SL / TP levels bar by bar across loaded history. SL before TP1 = Loss, TP1 or better = Win.
It recalculates automatically when any input or the timeframe changes. It is a quick overview, not a
tick-precise backtester: when one bar touches both sides, the order is estimated from the bar open/high/low.
